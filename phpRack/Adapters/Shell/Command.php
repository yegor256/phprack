     * make some strange forks and execute itself many times. This
     * behavior results server internal error.
     *
     * shell_exec() is also affected by this issue, we have earlier
     * this problem, and was solved by adding "env -i" before shell
     * command. Recently we have added PEAR support, which internally
     * execute PHP script, so problem returned.
     *
     * Direct reason of this error is $_ENV['PATH']
     * variable. When we unset it and pass modified env to
     * proc_open(). It works on Windows XP, Ubuntu Linux and solve
     * problem on phprack.com server.
     * But from some reason on MacOS there is some problem with
     * this env value reseting, and we lose some privilege? Due to
     * this fact, our unit tests fail, because PEAR test produce
     * error:
     *
     * <code>
     * touch(): Unable to create file /opt/local/lib/php/.lock
     * because Permission denied in /usr/local/PEAR/PEAR/Registry.php
     * on line 835
     * </code>
     *
     * If we pass null to proc_open() env param we have no problems
     * on MacOS, but problem on phprack.com still exists.
     *
     * That is reason why we must pass to this function custom env
     * param.
